# Bede Oui HatÄ±rlama Servisi (Bede Oui Reminder Service)

A reminder app for periodic tasks. Specially designed for the cloud mining task from the Stormgain app. Users should activate the mining session every 4 hours. That's why there is a button to open Stormgain app directly and that's why the default time gap for the reminder notification is 240 minutes (4 hours).

I developed the app in August 2021 and is currently not recompilable due to the changes in packages. I could rewrite the code but the app is no longer needed. I just added this to my Github to add it to my portfolio as my first Flutter app.

With this project, I learned scheduling and sending local push notifications, styling widgets and opening external apps.
